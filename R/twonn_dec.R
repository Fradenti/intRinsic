#' Estimate the decimated \code{TWO-NN} evolution with halving steps or vector of
#' proportions
#'
#' The estimation of the \code{id} is related to the scale of the
#' dataset. To escape the local reach of the \code{TWO-NN} estimator,
#' \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-11873-y}{Facco et al. (2017)}
#' proposed to subsample the original dataset in order to induce greater
#' distances between the data points. By investigating the estimates' evolution
#' as a function of the size of the neighborhood, it is possible to obtain
#' information about the validity of the modeling assumptions and the robustness
#' of the model in the presence of noise.
#'
#' @param X data matrix with \code{n} observations and \code{D} variables.
#' @param method method to use for decimation:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{"steps"}}{the number of times the dataset is halved;}
#'   \item{\code{"proportion"}}{the dataset is subsampled according to a vector
#'   of proportions.}
#' }
#' @param proportions vector containing the fractions of the dataset to be
#' considered.
#' @param steps number of times the dataset is halved.
#' @param seed random seed controlling the sequence of sub-sampled observations.
